# Markowitz-portfolio-optimization
# Overview
This project aims to optimize a portfolio of risky assets using Markowitz's mean-variance optimization technique. It involves gathering historical price data for selected assets, calculating returns, constructing the efficient frontier, and determining optimal portfolio allocations based on risk tolerance levels. Background

Markowitz's mean-variance optimization is a mathematical framework for selecting the optimal portfolio allocation by considering the trade-off between expected return and risk. It seeks to maximize return for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given level of return. The efficient frontier represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk.
# Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
Data Collection: Historical price data of 3 months has been collected of 10 stocks using investing.com. 
The stocks are TVEL, ADAN, INFY, SBI, ICBK, ITC, YESB, ZOMT, RYMD, VODA

Return Calculation: Simple returns are calculated from the historical price data.

Mean-Variance Optimization: Markowitz's mean-variance optimization is applied to construct the efficient frontier. 
This involves finding the optimal portfolio allocations that maximize expected return for a given level of risk.

Portfolio Construction: Portfolios are constructed based on different risk tolerance levels. 
Two points on the efficient frontier representing different risk levels are chosen, 
and the corresponding portfolio allocations are determined.
